# Science Memes
This is a collection of science-inspired visual memes I have created. All images were created or postprocessed via keynote: [sciencememes.key](sciencememes.key)

## 2023-01: Cyclist desire lines
A visualization of designed and actual paths for cyclists on a busy Danish intersection, following the paper [*Computational Desire Line Analysis of Cyclists on the Dybbølsbro Intersection in Copenhagen*](https://findingspress.org/article/56683-computational-desire-line-analysis-of-cyclists-on-the-dybbolsbro-intersection-in-copenhagen).

Photo of the same intersection, overlaid with hundreds of colorful cyclist trajectories going all over the place.")

## 2022-12: Urban speeds
A sketch depicting two different perspectives of speed in the city. Numerical values are in km/h.

![Urban speeds](images/202212urbanspeeds.png "Top human perspective showing scale: slow <5 km/h, medium 5-9 km/h, fast 10-19 km/h, deadly 20+ km/h. Bottom car perspective showing scale: slow <40 km/h, medium 40-59 km/h, fast 60+ km/h")

## 2022-10: PhD Calling
A popular visual meme created by manchildmanor.com, adapted to academia with the statement of an Ivy League Professor of how a PhD is not like real work with full pay but more of a calling.

![PhD Calling](images/202210phdcalling.png "Comic showing two men talking. Left man, with nice shirt and haircut: This is an underpaid PhD, but academia is a calling. Right man, looking worn down, folding hands and looking up: Oh that's perfect! My rent is actually 800 callings!")

## 2022-01: Mobility report
Application of the popular Drake meme to my 2021 Google mobility report which shows a lot of cycling but also thousands of km of air travel, ending with the title of the paper [*Air Travel and Urbanity: The Role of Migration, Social Networks, Airport Accessibility, and ‘Rebound’*](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/urbanplanning/article/view/3983) which describes this phenomenon.

## 2021-09: Cure the disease
A provocative sketch depicting one of the biggest problems in cities and how to cure it.

A city icon surrounded by red car icons, vaccinated with a blue syringe that contains a pedestrian and bike icon. Text: Cure the Disease. Reduce speeds, remove parking, give space to cycling, give space to walking")
